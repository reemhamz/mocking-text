## About üìñ
Wanted to play around with ChatGPT's coding capabilities to create a mocking text app just for fun!


The entire site has been developed with ChatGPT's capabilities. I just went in to make the following changes:
- Wrapped `label`, `input`, and `button` elements in a `form` tag
- Changed CSS code to remove GPT's `text-transform: uppercase` rule from the `input` element

## Findings üßê
It really lacked in writing accessible code, both in HTML and CSS. It did not wrap our `input` and `button` elements in a `form` element, which is very anti-pattern and can become inaccessible when using the web, and it also separated the `input` and `button` elements into different `divs`:
```
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="title">Mocking Text Generator</h1>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="input-text">Enter your text:</label>
    <input type="text" id="input-text">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <button id="convert-button">Convert to Mocking Text</button>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="converted-text">Mocking Text:</label>
    <p id="converted-text"></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Its CSS accessibility also wasn't the greatest. I had to go in at one point and edit the CSS even after I asked it to make the font text accessible:

It's obviously not ideal, and not a tool I would ever use to actually write up my websites. However, the JavaScript functions were much better than its HTML and CSS counterparts. I can see myself using ChatGPT to help me with working around JS problems than I would other languages.


## How to use ü™ú
Simply type whatever you'd like to convert into the input field, and press the 'Submit' button to see the converted text.
